            I spent years believing I was an anxious person seeking peace, trying every method to quiet my worried mind. Through Advaita Vedanta, I discovered the truth: I was never the anxious thoughts, I was the awareness in which they appeared and disappeared.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This recognition changed everything. Not because anxiety stopped arising, but because I stopped identifying as its victim. The peace I had been seeking was what I already was.
          </p>

            I now share this understanding with others who are ready to discover their true nature beyond the story of suffering.
